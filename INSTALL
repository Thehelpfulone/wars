Right. So you want to install WARS for some reason.

For security, I reccommend you move the smarty directories out of the web 
root, and maybe the source directory too. Remember to update the config 
variables to point the the right place too.

Create a file called 'localconfig.inc.php', and in there override any 
default values you need to.

You'll also need to create the directories:
	* smartyconfig
	* smartycache
	* smartycompile
...and make sure they're writable by the webserver
