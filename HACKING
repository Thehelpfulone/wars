Hey! Read this now if you want to edit any code!

Firstly a word on file locations (where $APPROOT is the base directory):

Smarty templates (the user interface) are stored in $APPROOT/template
Templates for a specific page are filed away in $APPROOT/template/page

$APPROOT/smartycache and $APPROOT/smartycompile should be *empty*

$APPROOT/smartyconfig is where the config file for smarty is stored, and also
should be empty, as this config file will be autogenerated.

$APPROOT/style should contain ONLY stylesheets. Anything else in here may be
"used" as a stylesheet.

Classes placed in $APPROOT/src will be automatically included by the
autoloader, you don't need to put includes/requires in the code for these, just
put the class in it's own file named the same as the class, and then just use
it.

New pages should be declared as a subclass of PageBase, and saved in 
$APPROOT/src/page, and implement the function runPage() to do anything. See 
$APPROOT/src/page/PageTeapot.php as an example. The new page will be available
at internal.php/Teapot (for example)
